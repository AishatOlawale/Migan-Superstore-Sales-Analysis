# Migan-Superstore-Sales-Analysis

Migan Superstore is a fictitious retail store in Myanmar that sells various categories of products to its customers. As the analyst, I am tasked with the analysis and exploration of the storeâ€™s 2019 Q1 dataset.

1. What is the performance of member customers as opposed to normal customers? 
2. The overall performance of the store in terms of revenue, profit, location, and product preference?
3. Preferred payment method and gender differences.

# Summary of findings

The performance of the supermarket was driven by strong performance in Naptyitaw, a preference for Food and Beverage products, and balanced use of payment methods.

- Product performance

The analysis of Migan stores' product lines reveals valuable insights. Food and Beverage products emerged as the top-selling items, reflecting the supermarket's success in offering a diverse food range.
The examination of product categories unveiled that Food and Beverage items stood out as the best-selling products within Migan stores. This underscores the supermarket's effective strategy of offering a diverse selection of food products, which garnered notable customer attention and played a substantial role in boosting its revenue. However, product preferences varied across cities. Naypyitaw favored Food and Beverages and Fashion Accessories, Yangon leaned towards Home and Lifestyle and Sports and Travel, while Mandalay's top products were Sports and Travel, along with Health and Beauty.
 
- Customer type

Another intriguing finding is the difference in purchasing preferences between member and non-member customers. Member customers were more inclined to buy Food and Beverage products, indicating the effectiveness of loyalty programs and targeted marketing for these products. On the other hand, normal customers' highest purchases were in electronic accessories, potentially indicating that this product category appeals more to the general shopper.

Among the locations, Naptyitaw stood out as the most lucrative, outperforming other regions in terms of sales.  

- Payment Method
  
Regarding payment methods, Cash emerged as the most preferred option among customers, followed by Ewallet and Credit Cards. This suggests that while some customers are embracing digital payment methods, a significant portion still relies on traditional cash transactions.
When analyzing the payment preferences across locations, interesting patterns emerged. In Naptyitaw, Cash was the dominant payment method, suggesting a preference for more traditional payment options. On the other hand, Mandalay saw Credit Cards as the most favored method, indicating a more digitally-inclined customer base. Meanwhile, Yangon customers leaned towards Ewallets, showcasing a tech-savvy population in the area.
